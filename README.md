## Web Development Examples!

This repo is for holding examples of HTML and CSS files for the Grl Developers web development curriculum. Feel free to use these files however you wish. In fact, I encourage downloading these files and messing around with them. Coding is best learned through experimentation!

#### A few things to take note of

I'll be uploading both html/css files and supplementary pdfs. The numbers beginning each file name indicate the order in which these topics will be taught.

This is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.
